  abstract = {The effect of solvent on the collapse dynamics of polymers is studied using computer simulation. Two cases are investigated, one where the solvent is incorporated through a pairwise additive attraction between the polymer beads and a random force on each polymer bead, and another where the solvent is incorporated in an explicit fashion as a second component. Brownian dynamics and molecular dynamics simulations are used in the former and latter model, respectively, with intermolecular interactions chosen so that the equilibrium size of the polymer is similar in both models at similar conditions. In the Brownian dynamics simulations, at short times local blobs of monomers are found separated by linear segments. With time the blobs grow in size and coalesce to form sausage like shapes. These sausages gradually become thicker and shorter until the final shape of a spherical globule is reached. The first stage is rapid whereas the second sausage-sphere stage is slow. In this stage the polymer often gets trapped in local minima and the change in size with time occurs through discrete jumps, and the equilibrium conformation is often not reached. In contrast, in the molecular dynamics simulations with explicit solvent, the size of the polymer changes smoothly with time, and the polymer does not get trapped in local minima for the cases investigated, although the sequence of polymer shapes is similar. This suggests that incorporating solvent molecules explicitly is important in the computer simulations of collapse and folding of polymers.}

  abstract = {Complex coacervation is the phase separation of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes, resulting in a polymer-dense coacervate phase and a polymer-depleted supernatant phase. Coacervation is crucial for many biological processes and novel synthetic materials, where the environment is often filled with other neutral molecules (crowders). Yet, the complex role of crowders in complex coacervation has not been studied systematically under controlled conditions. We performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of coacervation in the presence of polymeric crowders of varying concentrations and chain lengths. While short crowders do not have any significant effect on coacervation, larger crowders stabilize the coacervate against added salt, increasing its critical salt concentration. The change in critical salt concentration saturates for long crowders at a value determined by the crowder concentration. Rescaling all phase diagrams by their critical salt concentration leads to a collapse of the data, which demonstrates a universal phase behavior. Our simulation indicates that the inability of crowder chains to mix with the polyelectrolytes is the driving force behind crowding effects. These testable predictions provide a first step toward a comprehensive understanding of crowding effects in complex coacervation.}
